# deep-learning-challenge
by Andrea Monnerie

## Write an analysis that includes a title and multiple sections, labeled with headers and subheaders (4 points)
## Format images in the report so that they display correction (2)
## Explain the purpose of the analysis (4)
## Answer all 6 questions in the results section (10)

  Data Preprocessing

  * What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
  * What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  * What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

  Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  * What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

## Summarize the overall results of your model (4)
## Describe how you could use a different model to solve the same problem, and explain why you would use that model (6)
